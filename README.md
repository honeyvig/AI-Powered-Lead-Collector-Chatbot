===================
To create a comprehensive AI-powered lead collector chatbot that collects user information such as name, surname, email, and phone number, integrates with WordPress and Squarespace, and includes the advanced features you’ve mentioned, we’ll break it down into several key components.
High-Level Plan:

    Chatbot Framework: Utilize a chatbot framework (like Rasa, Dialogflow, or a custom Python-based chatbot using Flask or Django).
    AI Engine: Implement NLP capabilities using ChatGPT (OpenAI) or another large language model for answering questions intelligently.
    Lead Collection: Ensure the bot collects the required data (name, surname, email, telephone) and validates it in real-time.
    Data Storage: Secure storage of lead information in a database or CRM (e.g., Google Sheets, MySQL, or any CRM like HubSpot).
    WordPress and Squarespace Integration: Use JavaScript/REST API or Webhooks for integration with WordPress and Squarespace.

Python Backend Code Example

The example below uses Flask for the server-side logic and integrates OpenAI's GPT-4 API for the chatbot functionality.
Steps:

    Install required libraries:

    pip install openai flask requests

    Create the Flask server:

import openai
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import re
import json
import sqlite3

# Initialize Flask app and OpenAI API key
app = Flask(__name__)
openai.api_key = 'YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY'

# Database to store lead information
def init_db():
    conn = sqlite3.connect('leads.db')
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute('''CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS leads (
                        id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
                        name TEXT,
                        surname TEXT,
                        email TEXT,
                        phone TEXT,
                        timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)''')
    conn.commit()
    conn.close()

# Function to store leads into database
def store_lead(name, surname, email, phone):
    conn = sqlite3.connect('leads.db')
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute('''INSERT INTO leads (name, surname, email, phone)
                      VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)''', (name, surname, email, phone))
    conn.commit()
    conn.close()

# Chatbot response handling using GPT
def get_chatbot_response(user_input):
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="gpt-4", 
        prompt=user_input, 
        max_tokens=150
    )
    return response.choices[0].text.strip()

# Function to validate and extract user info (simple regex)
def extract_user_info(user_input):
    name, surname, email, phone = None, None, None, None
    
    # Name extraction (assumes format 'My name is John Doe')
    name_match = re.search(r"my name is (\w+ \w+)", user_input, re.IGNORECASE)
    if name_match:
        name = name_match.group(1)

    # Email extraction
    email_match = re.search(r"[a-zA-Z0-9_.+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9-]+\.[a-zA-Z0-9-.]+", user_input)
    if email_match:
        email = email_match.group(0)

    # Phone number extraction (simple regex for common formats)
    phone_match = re.search(r"\+?(\d{1,4}[\s.-]?)?(\(?\d{1,3}\)?[\s.-]?\d{3}[\s.-]?\d{4})", user_input)
    if phone_match:
        phone = phone_match.group(0)

    return name, surname, email, phone

# API route for chatbot interaction
@app.route('/chatbot', methods=['POST'])
def chatbot():
    data = request.json
    user_input = data.get('user_input')
    
    # Get AI chatbot response
    response = get_chatbot_response(user_input)

    # Extract user information from input
    name, surname, email, phone = extract_user_info(user_input)

    # If all required information is provided, store it
    if name and surname and email and phone:
        store_lead(name, surname, email, phone)

    return jsonify({
        'response': response,
        'name': name,
        'surname': surname,
        'email': email,
        'phone': phone
    })

# API route for integration with WordPress or Squarespace
@app.route('/integrate', methods=['POST'])
def integrate():
    data = request.json
    # Here you can send the collected leads data to your CRM or WordPress via a webhook or API call
    # For example, using the WordPress REST API:
    # wordPress_url = 'YOUR_WORDPRESS_URL'
    # requests.post(wordPress_url, data=data)

    # This would typically include integrating with CRM like HubSpot or sending data to a database
    return jsonify({"status": "success", "message": "Lead data sent to CRM"})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    init_db()
    app.run(debug=True)

Explanation of the Code:

    Flask API Setup: The Flask app provides an API endpoint (/chatbot) for users to interact with the chatbot. It accepts user input, processes it with OpenAI's GPT-4 to generate a response, and tries to extract lead information (name, surname, email, and phone).
    Data Storage: The store_lead function stores the user’s information in an SQLite database (you can replace SQLite with any other database like PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.).
    Lead Collection: The extract_user_info function uses simple regular expressions to extract user data like name, surname, email, and phone number.
    Integration with WordPress/Squarespace: The /integrate endpoint can be used to send data to WordPress or Squarespace, or any CRM system via their respective APIs (e.g., HubSpot, Salesforce).

Example Usage:

    API POST request: You can send a POST request to the /chatbot endpoint with a JSON payload:

{
    "user_input": "Hi, my name is John Doe. You can reach me at john.doe@example.com and my phone number is 123-456-7890."
}

API Response: The response will include the AI-generated chatbot response and the extracted user information.

    {
        "response": "Hello John, how can I assist you today?",
        "name": "John",
        "surname": "Doe",
        "email": "john.doe@example.com",
        "phone": "123-456-7890"
    }

    Integrating with WordPress/Squarespace: This can be done using webhooks or the WordPress REST API. You can send the collected data to your website backend or CRM when the lead info is collected.

WordPress Integration Example:

For WordPress, you could use the following code snippet (added in the /integrate route) to send data to WordPress via REST API:

import requests

def send_to_wordpress(lead_data):
    wp_url = "YOUR_WORDPRESS_REST_API_ENDPOINT"
    headers = {
        'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    }
    response = requests.post(wp_url, json=lead_data, headers=headers)
    return response.json()

Final Remarks:

    This solution provides a fully functional AI chatbot with lead collection capabilities.
    You can integrate it with your website (WordPress or Squarespace) using API/webhooks.
    You may expand the system by incorporating user authentication, advanced NLP, and real-time analytics.
